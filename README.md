# INF515: Comparative Genomics

Instructor: Marc Tollis (marc.tollis@nau.edu)<br/>

Please go to http://bblearn.nau.edu for weekly quizzes and to submit assignments

## Course Description
The purpose of this course is to familiarize informatics students with methods and theories behind comparative genomics. Biology is now a big-data science that is genomic in scale, and the growing availability of genome sequence data from across the tree of life challenges researchers to provide evolutionary explanations for this diversity. This course focuses on the analysis of genomic sequences, including sequencing technologies, genome assembly, functional and structural predictions, and comparisons at macroevolutionary timescales in a phylogenetic context. 

Special emphasis is on building practical skills in computational biology. Classes will consist of lectures, student led discussions of primary literature, and computational labs.

The course is modeled after other genomics courses being taught at [Cold Spring Habor](https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2017) and [Brown University](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus).

## Prerequisites
* The course is open to any NAU graduate student, although certain components are meant to benefit CS/Informatics, Biology, and Forestry students working on a thesis project.<br/>

## Resources
* Materials for the course are available at this repository. Go to the green "Code" button, and download the repository.<br/>
* Syllabus and policies
* NAU BBLearn (Blackboard) site - this will be primarily how you submit assignments and quizzes.

## Course Schedule
This is a tentative outline and topics may cary according to student needs. The course will be delivered in person but can be done remotely if quarantines are required. Attendance is strongly encouraged as there will be live coding demonstrations. It is important to be flexible in response to the changes the COVID-19 pandemic has made to the rhythm of our lives.
* All assignments for a given week are due on Sunday 11:59 PM. No late work is accepted. The two lowest quiz grades will be dropped.
* Email me questions with "INF515 F22" in the subject line. Please do not expect rapid responses over weekends (my advice is to START YOUR ASSIGMENTS EARLY IN THE WEEK).
