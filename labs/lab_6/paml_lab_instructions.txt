We will need to download PAML to complete this lab. You can install it on your own computer, or use Monsoon. It's up to you. I think it's better to do this on Monsoon since I know it works there (eahc of your own computers come with their own set of potential problems, no offense). The instructions are here http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html#download. Make sure you are downloading paml4.9j.tgz.
I think it's easier to run this on a Linux or Mac system, so after downloading, follow the instructions for "UNIX, linux, and other systems". If you are going to try to use Windows, then follow the instructions for Windows.
Once installed, add the PAML binaries to your PATH with
export PATH=/Users/path/to/paml4.9j/bin:$PATH.
Alternatively, you can simply add the absolute PATH to the paml /bin directory to your ~/.bash_profile
To do this, open up your .bash_profile
$vi ~/.bash_profile
and add a line: export PATH=/home/mt2245/tools/paml4.9j/bin:$PATH (make sure you have the right path that includes your userid and the right directory where you installed paml)
The only problem with using Monsoon means you have to move the lab files from there onto your Monsoon account. First, 


cd /scratch/mt2245/CompGenomicsCourse/fall22
mkdir paml && cd paml
wget http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml4.9j.tgz
tar xf paml4.9j.tgz

rm bin/*.exe
cd src
make -f Makefile
ls -lF
rm *.o
mv baseml basemlg codeml pamp evolver yn00 chi2 ../bin
cd ..
ls -lF bin

cd /scratch/mt2245/CompGenomicsCourse/fall22/paml
mkdir branch
mkdir branch_site

Then, move the branch files into the branch/ directory and the branch_site files into the branch_site/ directory, I use scp for this because I'm old school, but you may be able to use OnDemand ondemand.hpc.nau.edu.

We will use one degree of freedom in each of our tests.
