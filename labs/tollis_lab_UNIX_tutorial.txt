Intro to Mac Terminal and Cygwin
Make sure you have command line tools installed
Open up Terminal or Cygwin (if you have windows)
Explain prompt: name of machine, colon, tilda, userid, dollar sign (for bash), @ (for zsh), blinking cursor


$ whoami
$ pwd


directory structure
relative path vs absolute path


$ cd /Users/marc/Desktop
or
$ cd ~/Desktop
the tilda means... go to home directory and navigate from there
try going to a different folder
$ cd Applications
why didn't this work?
you didn't tell the absolute path
$ cd ~/Applications
or
$ cd /Users/marc/Applications
go back to Desktop
$ cd ~/Desktop


make a directory
$ mkdir tollislab_unix
$ ls
$ ls .
$ ls ~/Desktop


try tab complete
$ cd m <press tab, see how it completes>


create a file
$ vi unix.txt


VIM is a text editor (not a word processor) - there are other ones but let's not get into that. Type "i" to start editing in insert mode. type (with tabs as spaces):
1       lion
2       tiger
3       bear
4       fungus
Press escape to exit insert mode and type :wq to save and quit


Is the file in the directory?
$ ls


read the file
$ cat unix.txt
$ less unix.txt
$ q
$ head -2 unix.txt
$ tail -2 unix.txt


copy the file
$ cp unix.txt unix2.txt


Delete the copy
$ rm unix2.txt


Make a new directory
$ mkdir tmp
Delete the directory
$ rm -r tmp/
DO NOT DO WHILE DRINKING


go back one directory to the Desktop
$ cd ..


create another file
$ vi more_data.txt
enter insert mode and type:
5       zebra
6       tortoise
7       chimp
8       emu
save and quit


Whoops! You created a file in the wrong directory. Move it to the right one:
mv more_data.txt tollislab_unix/
$ ls tollislab_unix/


You realize these datasets should be combined
$ cd tollislab_unix/
$ cat unix.txt more_data.txt > alldata.txt
$ cat alldata.txt


$ wc -l alldata.txt
$ head -2 alldata.txt > head2.txt


Pipes: sends output of one program into another


How many files are in your directory?
$ ls . | wc -l


Just a list of animals
$ awk '{ print $2 }' alldata.txt


Print lines that contain a match to a string
$ grep “emu” alldata.txt


Print only the 2nd column of lines that contain a match to a string
$ grep “emu” alldata.txt | awk '{ print $2 }'


$ history
