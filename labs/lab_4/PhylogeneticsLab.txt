# IQ-TREE 2: New models and efficient methods for phylogenetic inference
# in the genomic era. Mol. Biol. Evol., in press.
# https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa015

# We will cover:
# 1) Downloading orthologous sequences from RefSeq (NCBI)
# 2) DNA sequence alignment
# 3) Model testing
# 4) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference
# 5) Bootstrapping

# There will also be some computing basics that we cover which are useful for other tasks. These include:
# 1) downloading binaries from a repository and adding them to your PATH
# 2) Use of UNIX-enabled text editors
# 3) regular expressions
# 4) secure copying data between computers

# Model Testing and ML Phylogenetic Inference: Test Data
########################################################

# we will perform model testing followed by ML inference of the best tree, and assess branch support with 1000 bootstrap replicates

srun iqtree -s example.phy -B 1000

# View the output

less example.phy.iqtree



# How many species (sequences) were in this alignment?
# What is the length (in nucleotides) of this alignment?
# What is the number of invariant (constant or ambiguous constant) sites?
# What is the proportion of parsimony-informative sites?
# What do you think "parsimony-informative" means?

# Which model was selected as the best fit, and according to what criteria?

# Use this substitution model cheat sheet (http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Substitution-Models) and the iq-tree output to answer the following questions:

# How many degrees of freedom (df) does the selected model have?
# Did the ModelFinder select the most complex model?
# How does the chosen model handle base frequencies?

# Numbers in parentheses are ultrafast bootstrap support (%)

# What is "bootstrap support", and how are those values calculated (hint: phylogenetics lecture)
# How do you interpret bootstrap support values that are less than 100%?
# Which branches have less than 100% bootstrap support?
# What does that tell you about what we can infer about the evolution of the clades stemming from those branches?

# Use an example. For instance, if you want to describe a clade where A and B are closer to C, you can use parantheses:
# ((A,B) C)
# The above desrcibes a monophyletic A and B with a C outgroup


# To perform the next part of the lab, you will need a laptop with UNIX-enabled terminal and a text editor that can handle regular expressions.

##############################################
# Download Orthologous Sequence Data from NCBI
##############################################

# Go to the NCBI Gene page https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/
# type 'BRCA1' in the search bar and click 'search'.
# Click 'orthologs' on the results screen.
# Click the dropdown arrows for vertebrates, mammals, placentals, primates, Old World Monkeys, apes, and New World monkeys.
# Hold down the command key and to simultaneously highlight Old World Monkeys, apes, and 'Callithrix jacchus'
# This should result in 21 orthologs.
# Click the white box to select all 21 orthologs.
# Click download, 'RefSeq transcripts (FASTA)', 'one sequence per gene', and Download.
# Choose where on your computer you'd like to save this file. Remember that and save!

# Now, open the saved file in your text editor (such as Sublime)

#####################
# Regular expressions
#####################

# Notice that the sequence headers contain a lot of information. There are two kinds of sequence headers. Ones that contain RefSeq transcripts for validated proteins in model organisms, such as:

# >NM_007294.4 Homo sapiens BRCA1 DNA repair associated (BRCA1), transcript variant 1, mRNA

# And ones that contain RefSeq transcripts for predicted proteins from non-model organisms, such as:

# >XM_008996686.3 PREDICTED: Callithrix jacchus BRCA1 DNA repair associated (BRCA1), transcript variant X1, mRNA

# Why are some orthologs 'validated' and some 'predicted'? Think about our Genome Annotation module.

# These headers are cumbersome, so to make things easier to visualize downstream, we need to change them
# to the species names only. We could do this manually, but in larger datasets this is not feasible. 
# Also, human make typos (espeically ones who use command line computing), 
# so we will use regular expressions to edit them.

# Access the find/replace module for your text editor. 
# In Sublime, I hold down the option, command, and F keys. Or go to the Find menu and click on 'replace'.

# Since there are two types of sequence headers, we need two regular expressions to edit the file.

# The first set look like this:

# >NM_007294.4 Homo sapiens BRCA1 DNA repair associated (BRCA1), transcript variant 1, mRNA

# I like to build regex commands by following the text patterns, 
# putting the replaceable items in parentheses.
# We have 
# (1) the greater-than sign, 
# (2) the refseq ID followed by a period, 
# (3) a version number followed by a space, 
# (4) the genus, 
# (5) a space, 
# (6) the species, 
# (7) the rest of the text all the way to the end of the line. 

# So the expression follows this in the Find bar:

# (>)(\w+).(\w) (\w+)(\s)(\w+).+

# and we want to keep only the greater-than (1), the genus (4) and the species (6), 
# so in the replace bar should go:

# \1\4_\6

# Note that I also am putting an underscore between genus and species. 
# This is a best practice in genomics :-)

# Depending on how your text editor is configured (mine is encoded for unix - everyone should do this) 
# you may have to add a line ending. 
# The \n ensures a line ending happens after the species.
# \1\4_\6\n

# Click Replace All. Scroll through the text file to make sure, 
# for instance you now have >Homo_sapiens

# Now let's edit the predicted transcripts:
# >XM_008996686.3 PREDICTED: Callithrix jacchus BRCA1 DNA repair associated (BRCA1), transcript variant X1, mRNA

# We have:
# (1) the great-than sign, 
# (2) the refseq ID followed by a period and 
# (3) a version number followed by a space, 
# (4) the word PREDICTED followed by a colon and a space, 
# (5) genus 
# (6) space, 
# (7) species, and the rest of the text all the way to the end of the line. 

# So the expression follows this in the Find bar:

# (>)(\w+).(\w) (\w+)\: (\w+)(\s)(\w+).+

# and we want to keep only the greater-than (1), the genus (5) and the species (7), 
# so in the replace bar should go:
# \1\5_\7

# save the file with the proper names.
# Go to terminal
# check your edited sequence headers

# Looks good!

# now, let's align with MAFFT. 
# We'll use the web version (one less thing to download and install)
# https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/

# copy the contents of the sequence file with the proper names.
# paste into input box.
# put BRCA1primatesAligned in job name box
# click submit. Should take about 5 seconds to align.
# Scroll down through the alignment visual on the screen
# Notice gaps.
# Click FASTA format to download.
# Do you know where your computer downloads items?
# My recent downloads are in my Chrome bar on the bottom.
