## RepeatMasker Lab

# The goal of this lab is to estimate and compare the repeat content of the human Y and chicken W chromsomes using the widely used RepetMasker software.

# Get genome files

# First, create directory and download the files

# create a project directory in your scratch, fill in below. We will name this lab 'repeats'
# make sure you turn userid into your id

export PROJ_DIR=/scratch/userid/CompGenomicsCourse/fall22/repeats

mkdir -p $PROJ_DIR && cd $PROJ_DIR

wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/fasta/gallus_gallus/dna/Gallus_gallus.GRCg6a.dna.chromosome.W.fa.gz

wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.Y.fa.gz

# Uncompress genome file and rename using symbolic links

gunzip Gallus_gallus.GRCg6a.dna.chromosome.W.fa.gz

# Uncompress genome file and rename using symbolic links

gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.Y.fa.gz

ln -s Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.Y.fa human.chrY.fa

## FUN WITH GREP
################

# how many nucleotides are human.chrY and chicken.chrW?

## example for human Y ##
# this is the inverse match of the number of characters in lines that have ">"

grep -v ">" human.chrY.fa | wc -c

# BUT, wc -c also counts line endings as characters 
# so we have to substract the number of lines

# this is the inverse match of the number of lines that have ">"
grep -v ">" human.chrY.fa | wc -l

# Hint: obtain the difference between those two numbers

# Is the human Y chromosome more AT-rich than the chicken W chromosome?

# Hints:

# count the As and Ts
grep -v ">" human.chrY.fa | grep -o "[A/a/T/t]" | wc -l

# count the Ns
grep -v ">" human.chrY.fa | grep -o "N" | wc -l

## RepeatMasking the genomes

# load the RepeatMasker module

module load repeatmasker

# set up resources - we'll use more than the default memory and 16 cores
# RepeatMasker runs rmblast on 4 cores by default.
# When you set the -pa flag, it will send rmblast searches on 4X that number of cores - multithreading!!!!

salloc --mem=16G -c 16

srun RepeatMasker $PROJ_DIR/chicken.chrW.fa -no_is -species gallus -pa 4 > chickenRM.log
# this will take a few minutes (less than 5). I will run this command without sending the output to a log file for demo purposes.

srun RepeatMasker $PROJ_DIR/human.chrY.fa -no_is -species homo -pa 4 > humanRM.log

# the human Y is larger so this will take longer (10-20 minutes)

# ls the contents of the project directory and screen shot into the lab worksheet.

ls $PROJ_DIR

## Analysis
###########


# ls the contents of the project directory

# the *.log files contain information about your RepeatMasker analysis that would have printed to the screen.

less humanRM.log

# What is the name of the search engine?
# What is the title of the database that was used?
# view the species/taxa search. what does the 'lineage' represent?
# how many repeat families for ancestral taxa were found?
# how many lineage-specific repeat families were found?

# compare these answers for both human and chicken .log files.

# what are the differences in (a) the lineage information and (b) the number of ancestral/lineage-specific families between human and chicken?

# now we wil turn to the *.tbl output files.

less human.chrY.fa.tbl

# does the GC level listed match your answer from the grep results above?
# how many bases were masked in the human Y chromosome?
# SINEs, LINEs, LTR elements, DNA elements are major types of interspersed repeats (TEs)
# Indented names, like Alu, MIR, LINE1, etc are clades of those types of repeats

# what is the most abundant type and clade of TE on the human Y chromosome? 
# Support your answer.

less chicken.chrW.fa.tbl

# does the GC level listed match your answer from the grep results above?
# how many bases were masked in the chicken W chromosome?
# SINEs, LINEs, LTR elements, DNA elements are major types of interspersed repeats (TEs)
# Indented names, like Alu, MIR, LINE1, etc are clades of those types of repeats
# what is the most abundant type and clade of TE on the chicken W chromosome?
# Support your answer.

# Let's compare our results to the complete genome repeat analyses on the RepeatMasker website.

# first, human
# http://www.repeatmasker.org/species/hg.html

# are the number of ancestral and lineage-specific repeat families in your analysis compatible with what is listed for RepeatMasker Library db20140131? Provide an explanation for any discrepency.

# are the percentage of interspersed repeats for the whole genome comparable to your RepeatMasker search of the Y chromosome? What about if you just consider the regions excluding Ns?

# now, chicken
